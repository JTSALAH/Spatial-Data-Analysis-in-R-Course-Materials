Run a MaxEnt species distribution model on a species of your choosing! Utilize the lecture slides as a reference for how to conduct this analysis, and feel free to use some of the datasets below. A MaxEnt SDM can be broken down into a few general steps:

1) Read in folder of bioclimatic variables (rasters)

2) Create a raster stack from bioclimatic variables (rasters)

3) Prepare occurrence points LONG/LAT for dismo input

4) Use ENMeval package to determine best model feature combination & beta multiplier.

5) Run MaxEnt model with dismo::maxent(), and make sure to include ENMeval settings!

6) Mask your raster stack to the study area that you want to predict the species distribution onto.

7) Utilize dismo::predict() to predict the species distribution in your study area.

8) PLOT!
